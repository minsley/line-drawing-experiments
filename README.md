## Notes
1. <a id="shapesSetupNote"/>This project relies on [Freya Holmer's](https://github.com/FreyaHolmer) wonderful Shapes and Mathfs libraries, which are not included in this repo. If you want to run the project you'll need to import them and remove the package dependencies from the manifest, or else move them into local packages yourself.
